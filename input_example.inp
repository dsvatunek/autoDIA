#--------------------------------------------------
Example input file
#--------------------------------------------------

# relative or absolute path to file with structures. Can be xyz file or G09 output from IRC, Scan, single point, frequency or geometry opt calculation

Input file = test.xyz

# Define a job name. Default is the input file name without file extension

Job name = test

#--------------------------------------------------
Information on Structures
#--------------------------------------------------

# Charge and multiplicity of the complex. Needs to be set for xyz files. Optional for G09 input 

charge = 0
multiplicity = 1

# Fragment information
# fragment name, default is fragment1 or fragment2.
Fragment1 name = Fragment1
# fragment charge and multiplicity have to be provided. Default is charge 0 and multiplicity of 1
Fragment1 charge = 0
Fragment1 multiplicity = 1
# list of the atoms in this fragment, provide a comma or space separated list, leave empty for automatic determination. If atom lists for both fragments are empty, then fragment 1 will contain the fragment containing atom 1
Fragment1 atoms = 
# Electronic energy of this fragment, required for calculation of relative energy of the complex and distortion energies. Defaults to 0.
Fragment1 energy = -243.485731

Fragment2 name = Fragment2
Fragment2 charge = 0
Fragment2 multiplicity = 1
Fragment2 atoms = 
Fragment2 energy = -464.752500

#--------------------------------------------------
Information for Analysis
#--------------------------------------------------

# Analysis can be turned on (YES) or off (NO), default is YES
Analysis = YES

# Distances can be extracted. Use atom numbers to define distances. Use one line per atom pair
# write "auto" in line to attempt finding a total of two bonds that get formed or broken.
<distances>
1 2
auto
</distances>

# Angles can be extracted. Use atom numbers to define angles. Use one line per angle
<angles>
1 2 3
</angles>

# Dihedral angles can be extracted. Use atom numbers to define angles. Use one line per angle
<dihedral>
1 2 3 4 
</dihedral>

Further Settings
#--------------------------------------------------

# If set to YES autoDIA produces XYZ files of all complex and fragment structures and saves them in a folder called <jobname>_xyz
Keep xyz = YES
# If set to YES autoDIA does not delete input files of all complex and fragment structures in folder called <jobname>_input
Keep input files = YES
# If set to YES autoDIA does not delete output files of all complex and fragment structures in folder called <jobname>_output
Keep output files = YES
# If set to YES autoDIA does not delete the log file called <jobname>_log.txt after successful termination
Keep log file = YES

#Set if structures should be reordered
reorder = NO

#Eliminate very similar structures based on a certain RMSD treshold
Reduce structures = NO
RMSD treshold = 0.2

#Does only prepare input files but does not run them, does not do analysis (use -a flag for analysis only)
Prepare only = NO

# provide the settings for single point calculations
# use $filename and $coordinates $charge and $multiplicity in places where they are required
