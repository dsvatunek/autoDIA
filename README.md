## a python tool for an automated Distortion Interaction/Activation Strain Analysis

The Distortion Interaction/Activation Strain Analysis is a powerful tool for the investigation of energy barriers. However, setup and data analysis of such a calculation can be cumbersome and requires lengthy intervention of the user. We present autoDIAS, a python tool for the automated setup, performance, and data extraction of such an analysis, including automated detection of fragments and relevant geometric parameters.
